# flightlog
This is the project proposal for the flight log app

## Project Team
* Kay Edwards  
## Research Area(s)
* User authorization
* Crud features 

## Problem Statement
> This app will maintain a history of flights from constant flyers. Clients will need to be able to log their experiences with their flight and flight hours in different weather conditions and types of aricraft. In the different experineces they will be able to document aircraft performance and any affects the flight had on the flyers body.
## Proposed Solution
> The Flight logging app is a website that will maintain the experiences of flights and flight affects made by flyers. The experience of clientâ€™s in the air is relevant because it exposes different cases of air travel from constant flyers. The features in the flight logging app aims to store a flyers unique cases of travel. There will be a schedule of a flight component where a client gets to store the latest flights they have taken or the ones they are about to take. They will be able to give a full description of the flight they plan on embarking. Once the flight is complete the flight will be stored and abled to be used for future reference. There will be a component with flight description to document aircraft performance and affcets of the flight on the body. This information will be beneficial for people to maintain records for certificate purposes, scientific research, and tracking the aircraft/personal performance in certain weather conditions.
