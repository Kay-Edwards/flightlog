# flightlog
This is the project proposal for the flight log app

## Project Team
* Kay Edwards  
## Research Area(s)
* User authorization
* Crud features 

## Problem Statement
> A website that manages clients' flights of all different types of aircraft. A client will be able to log the experience of their flight with different aircrafts for future reference whether it be for certificate, health, or professional development reasons. 
## Proposed Solution
>
The Flight logging app is a social website that will maintain the experiences of flights made by flyers and passengers. The experience of clientâ€™s in the air is relevant because it exposes people to different cases of air travel. The features in the flight logging app aim to share different information from profiles of people traveling everyday. There will be a schedule of a flight component where a client gets to show the latest flights they have taken or they are about to take. They will be able to give a full description of the flight they plan on embarking. Once the flight is complete the flight will become a profiler where people can update important information about their experience on the flight. This information will be beneficial for people to maintain records for certificate purposes, scientific research, and tracking the aircraft/personal performance in certain weather conditions.
